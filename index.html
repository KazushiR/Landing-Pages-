                    <p> This is the best model kit I have recieved. This is a great model to get into the higher end tier in terms of kit design and details.    </p>

                    <p> Thus us my first model on my model kit. It is very durable and very well built. Depending on the grade, it can be somewhat flimsy at some sections. </p>

                    <p> This is a model that is well built and has good durability. It takes sometime to build as well as some flimsy pieces. Otherwise, this is an excellent kit. </p>

                    <p> This kit is one of my favorite kits as well as something that has some good stability when put in a stance. </p>
